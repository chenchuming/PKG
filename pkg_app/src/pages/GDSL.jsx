            <a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/" target="_blank">The Neo4j Graph Data Science Library (GDSL)</a> is a set of algorithms and machine learning procedures that can be used to analyze and understand graph data. The GDSL is designed to be easy to use and to provide high performance.
            It is a powerful tool for analyzing and understanding graph data. It is easy to use and provides high performance and can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.


        </p>
        <p>It can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Link prediction:</strong> Identifying potential relationships between entities in a graph.</li>
            <li><strong>Community detection:</strong> Identifying groups of entities that are more closely connected to each other than to other entities in the graph.</li>
            <li><strong>Path finding:</strong> Finding the shortest path between two entities in a graph.</li>
            <li><strong>Similarity:</strong> Calculating the similarity between two entities in a graph.</li>
            <li><strong>Node embedding:</strong> Representing each node in a graph as a low-dimensional vector.</li>
        </ul>
